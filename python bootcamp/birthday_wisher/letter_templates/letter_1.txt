Dear shivani,

Happy birthday!

On your special day, we celebrate
The gift of your life, so full of grace
With each passing year, you only grow
More beautiful, more kind, more good to know

And oh, that smile, so bright and true
It lights up the room and warms us through
With laughter and love, you bring such joy
To all who know you, girl, you are a joy

So today we wish you all the best
May your heart be full, your soul at rest
And know that you are loved, so very much
Happy birthday, dear girl, we love you much!
